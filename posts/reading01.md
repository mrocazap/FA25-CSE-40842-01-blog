What does it mean to be a "true hacker"? Do you aspire to be one? Why or why not?
</strong>

As I read Part One of Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution by Steven Levy, one thought continuously popped into my head: Do true hackers still exist? 

A True Hacker, as described in the book, is a person driven by curiosity, whose eagerness to learn and explore stems from a place of passion rather than seeking external rewards. In contrast to most students nowadays, Steven Levy introduces us to a group of students in MIT who weren’t motivated by grades, money, or recognition; instead, they were simply motivated by the possibility of discovering something new or making something better, and while I found that mindset both inspiring and beautiful,  it left me with a sense of doubt. If I were asked whether I personally knew someone like that, my answer would honestly be no. 
Something that really stuck with me from the reading was the idea of the Hacker Ethic. According to Levy, a true hacker believes that:
All information should be free.
Access to computers, and anything that might teach you something about the way the world works, should be unlimited and total. 
Mistrust authority and promote decentralization
Hackers should be judged by their actual work rather than by degrees, age, race, or position.
Computers can change your life for the better. 
You can create art and beauty on a computer. 
In a way, the Hacker Ethic feels like more than just a set of rules;  it’s more like a way of living. I think many people would still agree with these principles, at least on a surface level. But then, when you really look at them, these ideas are contradicted by most of the systems we encounter today. If information should be free, as Levy describes, then it directly challenges a world that constantly puts a price on access. And I think this is where we fail as “true hackers”: so much of our culture is built on the pursuit of money, recognition, or personal gain that we lose the core of being a true hacker. We lose that curiosity and that passion that comes from within, not from an external source.

When Levy describes the MIT hackers writing programs for the PDP-1 and giving them away simply because they wanted to share, I couldn’t help but think about how unlikely that would be today. In our current world, people would ask for royalties or some form of ownership. Which makes me think of two main problems: first, we live in a society where information is abundant but often restricted; and second, technology is often framed as a means to an end; therefore, we rarely use it just for joy and curiosity, we do it for recognition, money, or some long-term gain. And when I think about it this way, it makes sense why we barely see any true hackers anymore. 

I wish I were a true hacker. I really envy those who are; those who do things for the joy of it, not because of a possible gain, and I envy even more those who not only enjoy it but also gain something from it. I wish I were the type of person who could just be passionate about something, but I’m simply not. Or maybe I just haven't found what I'm passionate about. Or maybe I have, but I lost the love for it because of the pressure that society constantly puts on us. We are constantly being told that everything we do, every skill we learn, every action we take has to be productive, has to in some way further our career, and maybe that's what doesn't allow us to enjoy it anymore. It's like when you are little and you find something you enjoy. For me, it was playing violin. But simply playing violin wasn't enough for my mom; she wanted me to be the best. So she made me go to class 2 times a week, but that still wasn't enough, so she made me be part of my school's orchestra, which meant another 3 hours, and instead of being fun, it just became something I did because I was told I had to do. So yes, I wish I could be a true hacker, I wish I could do things for the joy of it. But do I think I'm gonna get to that point, not really. I don't even know how to get that love and that passion for things that I have lost.
