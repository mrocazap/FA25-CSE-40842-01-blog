From your experience, which model of software development is superior: the cathedral or the bazaar? Which is the future of software development? Are the two models mutually exclusive?
</strong>

 Let me start this blog by saying I had never heard about the terms “Baazar” or “The Cathedral” before, and if they were simply just mentioned to me I would have in no way whatsoever even associated them with computer science.

From my understanding of the reading, “The Cathedral” is a software engineering model where it seems there is a group of software engineers that are selected to work on developing the code for a project that they have in mind, it seems to have a clear structure that is followed with a lead engineer and then the remaining employees who all have standardized tasks. The way the reading makes it seem, it looks like they are more worried about developing something and do not focus that much on the process of development or making it perfect, their main focus is making sure it works and it meets the requirements. 

On the other hand “tThe Baazar” seems to reflect more on the hacker ethics that we have explored before, it is a bit more “messy” and decentralized. Where the projects that are worked thrived because of the participation of different developers, users, and basically anybody who has any input and simply wants to help. Therefore they build things through collaboration. 

By this point, whoever takes the time to read my blog probably thinks I’m a materialistic person who only cares about money, but it’s not my fault we live in a world where money is necessary to survive. In a purely ideal world, the Bazaar model seems far more engaging, fun, and meaningful because it values everyone’s opinions and ideas. That kind of collaboration allows for diverse input, making it possible to create the best solutions collectively. Plus, it carries the simple joy of connecting and communicating with others just for the fun of it.

This week, while I was at the SHPE convention, I was in an elevator with my friend and a family that had a little girl, maybe three or four years old. As my friend was leaving to go to her hotel room, she said goodbye, and the little girl waved and said “bye” back. As the doors were closing, the girl turned to her mom and said, “Mommy, I just made a new friend.” The Bazaar reminds me of that moment, the simplicity of helping and being kind to each other just for the sake of it. The problem, though, as I’ve mentioned in probably all my blogs by now, is that the world doesn’t really work like that. Most people won’t do things purely out of kindness if there’s no form of compensation involved and that is whyI think most companies use the Cathedral model to guide them, as it is the one that will probably generate the most money for them. 

I honestly don’t think either model will ever truly “win.” In a way, both need a bit of each other to actually work. The Cathedral model could benefit from listening more to its users and focusing more on the process and having the best code possible, while the Bazaar model has to adapt to a world that still runs on money, because otherwise, who’s going to use it? Therefore, I think that in the end the solution is to mix both; this would allow us to keep the freedom, collaboration, and openness of the Bazaar while still finding a way to make it sustainable and profitable, which is needed in today's world.
