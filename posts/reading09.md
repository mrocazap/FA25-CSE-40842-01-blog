Today’s reflection is based on the book *Just for fun by Linus Torvald*

Do you find the story of Linus Torvalds' upbringing and creation of Linux inspiring, interesting, or irrelevant? How does his story compare to other computing industry titans such as Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, or Mark Zuckerberg? What do you wish your story to be?
</strong>

When I read about Linus Torvalds’ childhood, my first reaction was along the lines of "Great. Another child prodigy that did great things with his life”. Honestly, reading about how he found computers young and clicked with them instantly made me look back at my own childhood and wonder why no one forced me into advanced math at age six so I could also become a certified genius. The worst part of reading stories like Linus' is that I compare their childhoods and achievements to mine. Like, how did he find something that he was passionate and good about at such a young and early age? I'm 21 right now, and if I think about a skill I'm good at and passionate about, the only thing that comes to mind is sleeping.  I blame God for not making me interesting enough, I wish I could say I spent my childhood “messing with computers and figuring out how to make them run better,” the way Linus did, like that is soo cool.

Also, can we talk about him saying, “I got good grades without having to work at it — never truly great grades, exactly because I didn’t work at it.” Like… excuse me? It makes me so mad that some people can just be naturally good at things without even trying. He is just succeeding by accident. And what makes it worse is that he doesn’t say it in a braggy way at all so it's not like I can make fun of him he just drops it like it's a fact, can I please have his brain!

Now apart from his incredibly smart and having the possibility of having early access to computers which greatly impacted his abilities and knowledge and helped him get interested enough on them to continue working with computers. What makes Linus so interesting is the fact that he didn’t start his projects with a grand plan, instead it just started because he thought it was fun. He didn’t start because he wanted to disrupt the industry, build a company or become rich . He just did it because  it was fun for him. It feels like he is more straightforward and lacks the ambition and greed that a lot of the greatest in tech have, bro just wanted an OS that matched what he wanted and built it. And I think it opens my eyes to the possibilities in the world, like not every project that will have an impact has to start or feel like a giant vision, instead it can be led by curiosity.  And I feel like that makes him in a way much more relatable/friendlier than the other tech giants  because Linus in these first chapters seemed like he succeeded based not on being able to pitch a startup but on his curiosity. 

So I learned that maybe I do have a chance of creating something awesome that will have an impact and disrupt the tech world. Now the hardest part is step one: discover a talent that isn’t sleeping.
