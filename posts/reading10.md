Today’s reflection is based on the book *Just for fun by Linus Torvald*

What do you make of Linux's success? Is it proof of the power of hackers in the bazaar? Or was it simply a matter of fortunate circumstances? Will there ever be another open source success story as big as Linux?
</strong>

There are a lot of things that make Linux success stories different and inspiring. He wasn't like the other tech giants, he wasn't interested in the money of the business and therefore when he explains his success we see that he followed such a different story than others. 

He explains that adults, just like kids, are usually motivated by one of three things: Survival, Social order (which includes wanting recognition, attention, or feeling like you matter), or Entertainment. Most adults like to pretend they’re driven by ambition or the need to “be someone,” the same way kids want to be the king of the ball on the playground, and they convince themselves that this hunger for recognition is what pushes them to succeed. But Linus says that his motivation was completely different; he was driven by the third category, entertainment, meaning he worked on Linux simply because he found it fun, interesting, and enjoyable. 

Linus unlike other of the big giants and maybe because of the root of his motivation didn’t feel the need to sacrifice the basic things that make life actually livable or enjoyable. He even mentions the importance of sleeping, which, as everyone reading this blog already knows, is my strongest talent and therefore I will gladly interpret this as permission to nap more, and if my mom tells me I need to stop napping I’ll gladly tell her Linus says sleeping is important (although we both know that’s not what he meant). The point is that unlike the classic success story where someone gives up everything for their big dream, Linus found his success by following what genuinely entertained him. He wasn’t chasing status or starving himself of joy; he was just doing something he liked.

Maybe that is where we are all going wrong, maybe we are all pursuing a life where money is what we look forward to because that is the world we live in, but maybe we need to follow Linus' example and we have fun and money will follow.  At the end that is kinda what Linus wanted to tell people right? He is trying to encourage a world that is ruled by money to realize that being driven by motivations will produce the best results, it will encourage more innovation and just happier lifestyles compared to some of the other motivational factors. 

I think Linus is not the only success story of Open Source, in fact I think there are many more to come. But I do think getting to that point of success is not as easy and Linus makes it seem, I do think a lot of things have to line up for an open source project to take off as Linux did and a big part of that will be just luck. But if we continue having people who are passionate about creating new things and whose motivation is not just money then we will probably soon enough see a new success story.
